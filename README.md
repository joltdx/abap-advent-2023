# Advent of Code 2023 in ABAP

As the days go by, this is where I will be uploading my solutions in ABAP to the Advent of Code 2023


Code will be written and run on my ABAP Developer Edition 1909 docker
<br>Disclaimer: My main focus is simply to solve the puzzles in a reasonable time. I have no intention whatsoever of making the code clean, maintainable, configurable understandable or any other relevant adjectives, although I don't think it will be that bad actually.

I use a frontend written in [ABAP2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5) for input specification and retreiving the results

Template for this setup is in my [abap-advent-2023-template](https://github.com/joltdx/abap-advent-2023-template) repository
