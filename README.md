# Advent of Code 2023 in ABAP

As the days go by, this is where I will be uploading my solutions in ABAP to the Advent of Code 2023


```
GPT-4> Help me write a short poem about the github repository where I
       will be uploading the solutions to the advent of code challenges
```

```
In the realm where coders dwell,
On GitHub's servers, stories tell,
A repository stands tall, awoken,
Silent, till its code has spoken.

Born for Advent's coding race,
A crucible of logic's embrace,
Here, solutions find their home,
In this digital catacomb.

Day by day, solutions grow,
In the language that coders know,
Each new puzzle, a challenge met,
In the code, no regret.

Binary stars twinkle bright,
In the vast Git's endless night,
Commit by commit, push and pull,
The repository, never dull.

Through the Advent, coding wide,
The repository, our silent guide,
For every coder's quest, the key,
In this GitHub repository.
```

Code will be written and run on my ABAP Developer Edition 1909 docker

I use a frontend written in [ABAP2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5) for input specification and retreiving the results

Template for this setup is in my [abap-advent-2023-template](https://github.com/joltdx/abap-advent-2023-template) repository
