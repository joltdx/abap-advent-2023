# Advent of Code 2023 in ABAP
These are my solutions in ABAP to the Advent of Code 2023

Code written and run on my ABAP Developer Edition 1909 docker

I use a frontend written in [ABAP2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5) for input specification and retreiving the results

Template for this setup is in my [abap-advent-2023-template](https://github.com/joltdx/abap-advent-2023-template) repository
