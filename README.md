# Advent of Code 2023 in ABAP

This repository holds my solutions in ABAP for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles. I'm happy to have managed to complete all of the puzzles for 50 stars, and I learned a lot on the way! :)

Code was written and run on my ABAP Developer Edition 1909 docker

Disclaimer: My main focus was to simply solve the puzzles in a reasonable time. I had no intention whatsoever of making the code perfectly clean, maintainable, configurable, understandable or any other relevant adjectives. I think I typically used good verbose naming of things though, which always helps a bit. 

I used a frontend written in [ABAP2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5) for input specification and retreiving the results

Template for this setup is in my [abap-advent-2023-template](https://github.com/joltdx/abap-advent-2023-template) repository

So much fun!
